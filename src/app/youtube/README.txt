NOTE:
    The youtube api component used to access the youtube iframe api was taken from:
        https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-youtube-player

    Orginally, I tried to use npm install ng2-youtube-player, but due to the version difference I was unable to use the package.
    Instead, I looked through the source code and manually updated the broken files.

    All rights go to the orginal creator, the code is under MIT license is free to use for open source projects (like ours).


    Eventually, I would like to write my own youtube api component, but due to my lack of knowledge in angular/ts/js I had to make due
    with what I could find.

    The files used of his are:
        youtube-player.moudle.ts
        youtube.service.ts
        youtube.component.ts
